### Project details
- Create a Knowledge graph which depicts the Roadmap for “Data Science Tools”.
- Divide the main nodes into categories like “Collection”, “Cleaning”, “EDA”, “Model Building” & “Model Deployment”.
- Each category will have connections to some well-known tools used within that category.
- Every time you click a node, it will give you the list of resources to learn the tool (Now we will have very limited resources for testing).

### Project Setup
**Setting up a virtual environment:**
Recently I have been using UV to create the virtual environment and install the dependencies, if you not aware about it then please give it a read(It is created in Rust and can save your lot of time).
